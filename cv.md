   ```
   function list(names) {
        return names.reduce(function (p, k) {
            if (names.length == 1){return p + k.name}
            if (names[names.length-1].name != k.name && names[names.length-2].name !=k.name){
            return p+k.name + ', '
        }
        if (names[names.length-2].name == k.name) {
            return p+k.name
        }
        if(names[names.length-1].name == k.name){
